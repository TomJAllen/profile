        <h3>What I like</h3>
        <p>I am extremely passionate about a huge array of outdoor sporting activities - the more adventurous the better!
          This
          includes Triathlon, Bikepacking and Mountaineering. My main hobby over the past 4 years has been Rowing. I also
          enjoy gaming, with a specific focus on puzzle games, and have a long term goal to improve my coding skills and
          use them to develop a puzzle game in the same vein as Zork or Myst.
