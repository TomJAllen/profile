        Flatpack Features
      </h2>

      <p>Flatpack Features started as a lockdown project to improve our flat. As
        we began researching how to make some common home improvements and replicated
      them for multiple rooms, an idea blossomed about how this could be offered as a product.
     </p>
     <p>
      We then drafted out the idea, undertook some market research and put together a simple
      landing page to gauge interest.

     <p>While projects took precidence, the algorythms created to define materials required for
      any room

        <h3>Miscellany - a simple quiz Game</h3>
        <p>
          As a big fan of quizes, I set up a very simple quiz game. With some features that began to
          test out some more C# scripting, such as the timer and the progress bar I really enjoyed
          starting to see how the different components of larger games are added.
        </p>
        <p>You can play my quiz game either using the link below or

      Future Developement
    </h2>

    <p>
      I have been enjoying getting to grips with the Unity engine. The majority of the games
      I have worked on at this point have been 2D games, with a focus on learning the core
      functionality of the engine. I have a number of other ideas which will require me to start
      investigating 3D design and builds which I am extremely excited for.
