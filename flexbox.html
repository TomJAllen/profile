      </h2>

      <p>A Ruby on Rails Progressive Web Application which helps people make their perfect workout.

      FlexBox suits all fitness users from beginner gym goers to professional athelets. It provides strucutre to create a
      workout from our extensive database of exercises, save favourite workouts and see a workout history. The simple
      format
      of the app allows users to plan a well rounded warmup, workout or cooldown.

      Built with an interactive workout feature that guides your through your specified workout, Spotify Integration and a
      workout history - we have many more features planned!
      </p>
      <p>Each game was developed in the Unity engine and used some simple C# scripts to run</p>

        <h3>Miscellany - a simple quiz Game</h3>
        <p>
          As a big fan of quizes, I set up a very simple quiz game. With some features that began to
          test out some more C# scripting, such as the timer and the progress bar I really enjoyed
          starting to see how the different components of larger games are added.
        </p>
        <p>You can play my quiz game either using the link below or

    <h2>
      Future Developement
    </h2>

    <p>
      I have been enjoying getting to grips with the Unity engine. The majority of the games
      I have worked on at this point have been 2D games, with a focus on learning the core
      functionality of the engine. I have a number of other ideas which will require me to start
      investigating 3D design and builds which I am extremely excited for.
