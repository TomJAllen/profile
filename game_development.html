      <h2>
        Game Developement
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Gaming is a hobby that I have enjoyed since I got my first games console for christmas
        at the age of 6. It has provided me with some incredible experiences - whether that be
        beating my first Dark Souls boss, working out my first challenging Myst puzzle (without help
        from the internet), hitting a clutch Warzone / Fortnite vicotry while my the rest of my
        team watch on or even just expereincing the masterful storylines of a MGS or the latest GOW.
        Gaming is a medium that can often times offer so much depth and immersion and has enabled me
        to connect with friends that no longer live close or even make new friends.

        With the development of advanced game engines that are accessible to anyone, I would love to
        build on this hobby and make it a more permenenant part of my life. With my existing
        developement skills and a head full of ideas, I have been intially trying my hand at game
        developement using the Unity game engine. So far I have created
        three simple concepts, following the course outlined by GameDev.tv to get an understanding of
        how I can implement my ideas. These include a simple top-down old school gta style pizza delivery game,
        a sidescrolling snowboard game and a quiz game details of which are outlined below.

      <h3 class="game-title">Pizza delivery</h3>
      <div class=game>
        <div>
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>A simple top-down old school gta style Pizza delivery game. This was the
            first project I made in Unity and was aimed to get to grips with placing objects
            in the environment and working with colliders / rigid bodies.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Core Mechanics + Game loop</h4>
          <p>The main game loop was to pick up and then deliver a pizza to a hungover customer.
            Key mechanics were the ability to pick up a pizza and having to deliver it before
            picking up the next pizza, a slow down mechanic that impated the car whenever an
            obstacle was hit as well as a boost function, to speed up the car whenever a boost
            was driven over.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Additional Features / Improvements</h4>
          <p>While this was my first attempt at creating a game, I would like to revisit this
            project at some point and apply additional skills learnt to make this more rounded
            as a standalone project.
            Key items to add would be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Scoring system</li>
            <li>Time limit</li>
            <li>Random spawning of pizzas + customers</li>
            <li>A clear UI with key info</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <h3 class="game-title">Snowboard sidescroller</h3>
      <div class=game>
        <div>
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>A simple side scrolling snowbaord game, where players must reach the finish
            without crashing. The aim of this project was to apply the skills learnt in the
            delivery game but to work with some other features such as sound effects and
            gravity.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Core Mechanics + Game loop</h4>
          <p>The player must guide the snowboarder to the end of the level without crashing.
            Key mechanics were the ability to rotate the character in the air and to speed up
            when pressing forward. Only one level was created and this restarts upon completion.
          </p>

        <div>
          <h4>Additional Features / Improvements</h4>
          <p>Similarly, I would like to revisit this to add some more content to make it a
            standalone game.
            Key items to add would be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Add in tricks</li>
            <li>Additional levels</li>
            <li>Scoring system</li>
            <li>A clear UI with key info</li>
          </ul>

      <h3 class="game-title">Miscellany - a simple quiz Game</h3>
      <div class=game>
        <div>
          <h4>Description</h4>
          <p>
            As a big fan of quizes, I set up a very simple quiz game. With some features that began to
            test out some more C# scripting, such as the timer and the progress bar I really enjoyed
            starting to see how the different components of larger games are added.
            You can play my quiz game either using the link below or
            <a href="https://i.simmer.io/@TomJAllen/miscellany">here on simmer.io</a>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Core Mechanics + Game loop</h4>
          <p>The player must answer a set of quiz questions and is given a score based on performance
            . There is a time limit of 15 seconds per question, after which the player will not score.
            The player is presented with their score at the end and can try the quiz again.
          </p>
        </div>
        <img class="game-img" src="images/quiz_game_3.png" alt="Quiz Game Screenshot">
        <div>
          <h4>Additional Features / Improvements</h4>
          <p>With this being my first game which has an intro screen and navigation for the user
            to start / restart the quiz,
            Key items to add would be:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>More questions + </li>
            <li>Randomise questions</li>
            <li>Add a different style of question</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      Future Developement
    </h2>
    <br>
    <p>I have been enjoying getting to grips with the Unity engine. The majority of the games
      I have worked on at this point have been 2D games, with a focus on learning the core
      functionality of the engine. I have a number of other ideas which will require me to start
      investigating 3D design and builds which I am extremely excited for.
