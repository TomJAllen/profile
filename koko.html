        <h3>Miscellany - a simple quiz Game</h3>
        <p>
          As a big fan of quizes, I set up a very simple quiz game. With some features that began to
          test out some more C# scripting, such as the timer and the progress bar I really enjoyed
          starting to see how the different components of larger games are added.
        </p>

      Future Developement
    </h2>

    <p>
      I have been enjoying getting to grips with the Unity engine. The majority of the games
      I have worked on at this point have been 2D games, with a focus on learning the core
      functionality of the engine. I have a number of other ideas which will require me to start
      investigating 3D design and builds which I am extremely excited for.
