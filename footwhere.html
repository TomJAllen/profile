        Footwhere
      </h2>

      <p>One of my first team projects on my bootcamp. The purpose of this project
        was to test out our middway skills, learning to work with other developers
        and learning all the skills to ensure we could launch an MVP.
        Footwhere is a Ruby on Rails application for those who need a specialist shoe - fast!</p>

        <h3>Miscellany - a simple quiz Game</h3>
        <p>
          As a big fan of quizes, I set up a very simple quiz game. With some features that began to
          test out some more C# scripting, such as the timer and the progress bar I really enjoyed
          starting to see how the different components of larger games are added.
        </p>
        <p>You can play my quiz game either using the link below or

      Future Developement
    </h2>

    <p>
      I have been enjoying getting to grips with the Unity engine. The majority of the games
      I have worked on at this point have been 2D games, with a focus on learning the core
      functionality of the engine. I have a number of other ideas which will require me to start
      investigating 3D design and builds which I am extremely excited for.
